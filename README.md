# movie-recommender-system
Have enjoyed a movie a lott and wanna see another movie but of same type, this web-app will help you to find the movies you are searching for!!

A content based movie recommender system. It used TMDB 5000 movies dataset. On selecting a movie, it recommends five movies similar to the selected movie and redirect you to the OTT platforms where you can watch them. This web-app uses 2 APIs namely, TMDB API to get the posters of the movies and Streaming Availability API to get the links of the OTT platforms. The region is set to India, so it will redirect you to indian region platforms. The Streaming Availability API has limit of 100 calls per day, so it might not work after that for that day, but will soon change that case.

Do try this web application using the following link: https://lets-try-movies.herokuapp.com/

The landing page of the web-app is as shown below:
